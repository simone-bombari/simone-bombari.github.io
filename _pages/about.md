Hi! I am Simone Bombari, and this is my website! :muscle:

I am a PhD student at [ISTA](https://ist.ac.at/en/home/), happy and lucky to be advised by Professor [Marco Mondelli](http://marcomondelli.com/).
Right now, I enjoy thinking about research questions connected with deep learning, high dimensional probability, and trustworthy machine learning. For example, I like to think if _over-parameterized_ models trained on _high-dimensional_ data hide some _not-necessarily-trivial_ behavior, with maybe some implications connected to privacy or robustness.

Before joining ISTA I studied Physics at [Scuola Normale Superiore](https://www.sns.it/en) and [University of Pisa](https://www.unipi.it/index.php/english). During my studies, I ended up focusing on statistical physics and quantum information. Then, I slowly migrated towards statistics and machine learning. :computer:

During my PhD, I had the opportunity to intern as an applied scientist at AWS, and as NLP quant researcher at [G Research](https://www.gresearch.com/). Since the fall of 2024, I am supported by a [Google PhD fellowship](https://research.google/programs-and-events/phd-fellowship/recipients/). I am currently a visiting scholar at the University of Southern California.

Of course, I have many interests beyond my research. I have a deep passion for sports, fitness, games and many other things! :soccer:
