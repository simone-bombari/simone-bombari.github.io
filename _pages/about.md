Hi! I am Simone Bombari, and this is my website! :muscle: :sunglasses:

I am a PhD candidate at [ISTA](https://ist.ac.at/en/home/), happy and lucky to be supervised by Professor [Marco Mondelli](http://marcomondelli.com/).
Right now, I enjoy conducting research on topics some sort connected with deep learning, high dimensional probability, and trustworthy machine learning. As an example, I like to think if over-parameterized models hide some not-necessarily-trivial behavior, with maybe some implications connected to privacy or robustness.

Before joining ISTA I studied Physics at [Scuola Normale Superiore](https://www.sns.it/en) and [University of Pisa](https://www.unipi.it/index.php/english). Then, my passion for modelling and statistics led me to change field, and to approach the interesting (and weird) world of machine learning! :computer: :books:

During my PhD, I had the luck and opportunity to intern as an applied scientist at AWS, and as NLP quant researcher at G Research. Since the fall of 2024, I am supported by a Google PhD fellowship.

Of course, I'm much more than just a PhD student in theoretical ML. I have a deep passion for sports, [fitness](https://simone-bombari.github.io/projects/1_project/), games and many other things! :soccer: :space_invader:
