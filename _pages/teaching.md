I was teaching assistant for the Data Science Track Core Course in ISTA in 2022, and will hold the same role the upcoming spring. :chart_with_upwards_trend:

I also like to go back to my high school to provide training classes for the Math and Physics Olympiads. :game_die: :bulb:

I will add sub-pages regarding this soon! :alarm_clock:
