I was teaching assistant for the Data Science Track Core Course in ISTA in 2022 and 2023. If you are interested in following this course, and you are curious about the covered topics, feel free to reach out! :chart_with_upwards_trend:

I sometimes also visit my high school to provide training classes for the math and physics olympiads :game_die: :bulb:

More recently, I provided very basic, wide, and non technical presentations about machine learning and artificial intelligence. If you are interested in old material or you have any question about this, send an email (in Italian is fine :blush:)!
