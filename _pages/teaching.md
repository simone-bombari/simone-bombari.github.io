I was teaching assistant for the Data Science Track Core Course in ISTA in 2022 and 2023. In 2025, I was teaching assistant for a course on Deep Learning Theory at ISTA, where I gave few lectures on concentration of random kernels, and its connection to optimization. If you are interested in any of these courses, or simply curious about the covered topics, feel free to send me an email.

I sometimes also visit my high school to provide training classes for the math and physics olympiads. More recently, I tend to provide very basic, wide, and non technical presentations about machine learning and artificial intelligence, always for high-school audiences. If you are interested in old material or you have any question about this, feel free again to send me an email.
